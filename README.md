loadoff
=======

When testing how code changes affect total loading times, it can be difficult to compare to a previous benchmark set with a different client OS, hardware, browser, location or connection speed. Load-Off provides a clean interface that allows you to test the current load time of your beta site/page directly against the current load time of your production site/page. It also provides some basic statistics and plots that may be useful when showing off how much faster your new code loads.
